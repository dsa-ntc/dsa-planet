[Read our announcement post on tech.dsausa.org 
here](https://tech.dsausa.org/introducing-dsa-feed-an-aggregator-for-dsa-publications-from-the-ntc/)

DSA Feed is a web feed aggregator forked from [Planet
openSUSE](https://planet.opensuse.org) that collects blog posts from various DSA
chapters across the country, national working groups and committees, and our
local and national publications. 

## Adding your feed

If you want to get your website or publication added, we need your webpage to
have an RSS feed. Any WordPress or many other providers provide this by default!
Once you have your RSS feed, submit it over via the [new Feed
form](https://github.com/dsa-ntc/dsa-planet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=addition&projects=dsa-ntc%2Fdsa-planet&template=feed-request.yml&title=%5BFEED%5D%3A+)

Alternatively you can send an email to 
[ntc@dsacommittees.org](mailto:ntc@dsacommittees.org?subject=%5Bdsa-feed%5D%20&body=I%20have%20a%20question%20about%20DSA%20Feed)
with all the mandatory information listed above

Don't want to wait or want to help with something else? You can submit code yourself!
